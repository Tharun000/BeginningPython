# Variables are like Boxes. Their name remains the same, but values can be changed over the time.

number1 = 7
number2 = 4

print(number1 * number2)  # insted of values, we now write variables here.
print(number1 - number2 * 3)
alpha = number1 / number2
beta = number1 // number2
print(type(alpha))  # Prints type of variable
print(type(beta))

# Now, let us change the value of variable 'number1'

number1 = 32
print(number1 * number2)

# Task1: Try printing the values in a more informative format, as done in "1_Syntaxes.py" file.
